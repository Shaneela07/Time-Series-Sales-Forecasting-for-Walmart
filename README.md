🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting — Time Series Analysis with ARIMA, SARIMAX, FBProphet & LSTM
---
📘 Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting of Walmart’s weekly sales using a combination of statistical and deep learning models. The goal is to analyze historical sales data, capture seasonality and trends, and build predictive models that can help in demand planning, inventory management, and business decision-making.

🚀 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, trends, and seasonality in sales data.

Preprocess and transform time series data for model readiness.

Build and compare multiple forecasting models — ARIMA, SARIMAX, Facebook Prophet, and LSTM.

Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R².

Visualize forecasts and residual errors for interpretability.

🧠 Models Implemented

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):
Captures linear dependencies and short-term autocorrelation in the sales data.

SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables):
Extends ARIMA by incorporating seasonality and external regressors like holidays, fuel prices, and temperature.

Facebook Prophet:
Handles seasonality, holidays, and trend changes intuitively with automatic hyperparameter tuning.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
A deep learning approach that learns complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns for long-term forecasting.

⚙️ Workflow

Data Preparation: Parse dates, handle missing values, resample weekly, and scale features.

Feature Engineering: Add holiday flags, moving averages, and lag features.

Model Training: Fit each forecasting model with hyperparameter optimization.

Evaluation: Compare models on validation set and visualize results.

Forecast Visualization: Plot historical vs. predicted sales with confidence intervals.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

📈 Results
